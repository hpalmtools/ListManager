Choose a project you have access to: List Admin will show
you all the list and their values. You can edit anything you want.

You can export the lists to Excel, and re-import them later. This is very useful to 
propagate list values between QC/ALM projects. This is also useful to load list values from external sources 
(get them into Excel, then import using List Admin).
